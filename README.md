# RocketLaunchDelays
## Written in Python with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code.
 
You will need Python AI libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. You will need Anaconda as well. I used an Anaconda environment.
 
With this project I predict whether a rocket launch will take place given a set of weather information.
 
The "RocketLaunchDataCompleted.xlsx" file is the dataset. 80% of it is used for training and the rest is used for testing.
 
### The rocket-launches.ipynb contains the neccesary code to train a machine learning algorithm. I used a decision tree classifier because of the nature of the problem is a two class classification (yes or no are the possible output). Down below you can see a machine learning algorithm cheat sheet image provided by Microsoft resuming which algorithm to use given a certain situation.

This was a part of a Microsoft Learn learning path.
